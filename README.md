# Weather Analytics Dashboard (Frontend)

This is a minimal, runnable React frontend for the Weather Analytics Dashboard assignment.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `REACT_APP_OWM_API_KEY` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This project is frontend-only and uses OpenWeatherMap One Call API (3.0). The API key is required.
